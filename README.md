## 🚀 About Me

I'm that guy who gets excited about turning raw data into meaningful insights! Currently studying Computer Engineering at Covenant University, but honestly? Most of my recent passion has been diving deep into **Machine Learning** and wondering why my model thinks a car is going 500 mph. 😅

### 🧠 What Gets Me Out of Bed Every Morning

I'm obsessed with the intersection of **finance and artificial intelligence**. There's something magical about teaching machines to understand market patterns, predict financial trends, and spot opportunities that humans miss. It's like giving a computer the ability to see patterns that are invisible to the naked eye.

My journey started with hardware engineering, but I fell in love with the software side when I realized I could make sensors not just collect data, but actually **think** about what that data means.

- 🎓 **Education**: Computer Hardware Engineering @ Covenant University
- 🤖 **Passion**: Machine Learning & AI Engineering
- 💰 **Focus**: Building scalable AI solutions for fintech
- 🎨 **Creative Side**: Graphic Design, Video Editing, Animation
- 🏋️ **Philosophy**: Peak performance in mind, body, and code
- 🎯 **Goal**: Creating AI solutions that generate passive income globally

## 🎯 Featured Projects (My Digital Playground)

### 🤖 [Data Science Portfolio](https://github.com/olatunjitobiloba/Data-Science-Portfolio)
My journey into the world of data science and machine learning. This is where I experiment, break things, fix them, and occasionally create something that actually works!

**What's Inside**:
- Machine learning algorithms from scratch
- Real-world data analysis projects
- Financial prediction models
- Data visualization that actually tells a story

**Tech Stack**: Python, Jupyter Notebook, Pandas, NumPy, Scikit-learn, TensorFlow

### 🚗 [Speed Detector System](https://github.com/olatunjitobiloba/Speed-Detector)
Remember when I said I started with hardware? This IoT-based speed detection system is proof! Using IR LEDs, transistors, and sensor pairs to calculate vehicle speed in real-time.

**The Cool Part**: The microcontroller doesn't just collect data—it processes IR sensor information and calculates speed using the fundamental distance/time relationship. It's like teaching physics to a computer!

**Tech Stack**: Embedded C, Microcontroller Programming, IoT Sensors, Real-time Processing
